# Graph Knot

Graph theory provides a useful way to measure and describe functional network structure in the brain (Gits, 2016). 
Unfortunately, a high barrier to entry has hindered its utilization in cognitive neuroscience. Graph Knot offers 
a streamlined process for analyzing functional networks with graph theory, and in future versions aims to improve
upon existing visualization methods for functional networks.
