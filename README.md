# About
Graph theory provides a useful way to measure and describe functional network structure in the brain ([Gits, 2016][1]).
Unfortunately, a high barrier to entry has hindered its utilization in cognitive neuroscience. Graph Knot offers 
a streamlined process for analyzing functional networks with graph theory, and in future versions aims to improve
upon existing visualization methods for functional networks.

# Background

# To Do
- ~~Create Dropbox link for reference literature~~
- Review literature
-- Determine node and graph level indices (NLIs; GLIs) of topical interest
-- Identify knowledge gaps in the field
-- Centralize prereqs for learning these techniques
- List all assumptions of input data when using this software
- Decide on input and output filetypes
- Plan a data flow chart

# Feature wish list (keep these cited, if possible)
- Output NLIs, GLIs
- Contextual links to more information about each measure
- Save output as file
- Automatic atlas-based ROI generation
-- Freesurfer atlases
-- AAL
-- Harvard/Oxford
- Dynamic network measures?
-- Maybe just cross-sectional tests for modulation
- visualization (the big one)
-- nodes AND edges
-- enable colorized factors (network subcomponents?)
-- 3D rotation would be nice
